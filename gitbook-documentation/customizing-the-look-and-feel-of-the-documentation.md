# Customizing the Look and Feel of the Documentation

Once the documentation site was published, I explored GitBook’s customization options to adjust the visual style, layout, and branding of the Space.\
Even though GitBook aims for simplicity, it still provides a decent level of control over how your documentation looks.

#### Cover and Branding <a href="#cover-and-branding" id="cover-and-branding"></a>

Each Space can have a **cover image**, **title**, and **description** that appear on the homepage or in the GitBook dashboard.\
This helps personalize the documentation and make it easier to identify among multiple projects.

To set a cover:

1. Go to the Space settings.
2. Upload a cover image and edit the title or description.
3. Optionally, add a logo or favicon for branding consistency.

#### Theme and Colors <a href="#theme-and-colors" id="theme-and-colors"></a>

GitBook supports both **Light** and **Dark** themes by default.\
Viewers can toggle between them in the top-right corner of the documentation interface.

For published documentation, you can also define an **accent color** (used for links, highlights, and buttons) from the Space settings.\
This small touch helps align the documentation visually with your project’s design or company branding.

#### Navigation and Structure <a href="#navigation-and-structure" id="navigation-and-structure"></a>

You can easily organize content by rearranging pages in the left-hand sidebar.\
GitBook allows nesting pages into hierarchical sections, which is ideal for structuring large documentation sets.

You can:

* Drag and drop pages to reorder them.
* Group related pages under parent sections.
* Rename or hide pages from navigation.

This provides a clean, intuitive navigation structure without needing to edit any configuration files.

#### Reading Experience <a href="#reading-experience" id="reading-experience"></a>

The published documentation site automatically adapts to different screen sizes, offering a **responsive** and **minimalist** layout.\
Headings, code blocks, and tables are styled consistently to ensure readability across devices.

Users can also switch between:

* **Edit mode** → for internal contributors.
* **Reader mode** → for public or private viewing.

#### Observations <a href="#observations-2" id="observations-2"></a>

* The customization options are limited but well-chosen — easy to configure without overcomplicating things.
* Having both light and dark themes by default is a plus for readability.
* The ability to reorder pages visually (drag and drop) makes organizing documentation effortless.
* Custom covers and accent colors give just enough flexibility to personalize a Space.
